                    The sun or sol, is the star at the centre of our solar systerm and is responsible for the earth's climate and weather.

                <p>
                    The sun is an almost perfect sphere with a difference of just 10km in diameter between the poles and the equator. The avarage radius of the sun is 695, 508 km (102.2x that of the earth) of which 20-25% is the core.
                </p>
                <p>
                    if a hollow sun was filled up with sperical earths then around 960,000 would fit inside. on the other hand if these earths were squished inside with no wasted space then around 1 300 000 would fit inside. the sun's area is 11 990 times that which of the earth's.
